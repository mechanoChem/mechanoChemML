# Overview

mechanoChemML is a machine learning software library for computational materials physics. It is designed to function as an interface between platforms that are widely used for scientific machine learning on one hand, and others for solution of partial differential equations-based models of physics. Of special interest here, and the focus of mechanoChemML, are applications to computational materials physics. These typically feature the coupled solution of material transport, reaction, phase transformation, mechanics, heat transport and electrochemistry.
